## About Me 🚀

I'm a purpose-driven **Web Developer** focused on building digital solutions that solve real-world problems and advance human potential. With skills in **front-end development**, **portal systems**, and **WordPress**, I love turning ideas into usable, meaningful products.

I believe technology is a powerful tool for transformation, and I see my work as part of a greater calling—to build platforms that serve people, steward resources wisely, and echo the Kingdom of God on earth 🌍✨

- 🌱 Currently learning: **React Native**, **Next.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**

- 🌍 Languages: **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** | Fluent in **English & Swahili**
- 📫 How to reach me: **kjairo@hadithidigital.com**
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love video games and make weird (but surprisingly delicious) sandwiches with bread I probably love too much 🍞🎮
